# Tsunami014's Neovim configuration
This is just for my own use, use as you please.

This contains some extra stuff I made:
- A markdown highlighter which actually works and is pretty cool
- Slight modifications to the keybinds
- Other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head

## 🛠️ Installation
