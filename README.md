# Tsunami014's Neovim configuration
This is just for my own use, use as you please.

This contains some extra stuff I made:
- A markdown highlighter which actually works
- Slight modifications to the keybinds
- Other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head

## 🛠️ Installation

### Make a backup of your current nvim and shared folder if you care about your current config (if not or if you don't have one don't worry)
```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
```

### Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tsunami014/nvimConfig ~/.config/nvim
```
(or to `%userprofile%\AppData\Local\nvim` on Windows)

### Start Neovim
```shell
nvim
```
